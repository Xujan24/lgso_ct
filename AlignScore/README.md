## Acknowledgement

In this work, we used the source code for `AlignScore` from their official [github repository](https://github.com/yuh-zha/AlignScore). We made a slight adjustment to the `alignscore.py` file as per our requirements, and excluded some files for the same. We have also included a copy of the `LICENSE`.

We used the `AlignScore-large` checkpoints to load the model (RoBERTa-large). Details including installation, training, inference and download links for the checkpoints can be found on the github repository.
